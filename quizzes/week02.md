**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
2 - arrays start at position 0 and continue on by 1's. [0,1,2,3,4,5] and so on..
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }

how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
if (you.friends > them.friends){
  console.log('This is a conditional')
  }  else {
      console.log('Still a conditional')
    }

```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
This is called the iteration. It increases or decreases the counter. i++ would increase the counter by one on every iteration

```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
