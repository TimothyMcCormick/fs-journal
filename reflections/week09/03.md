## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding representing binary data in an ASCII string format.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

The base64 encoded data is about 33% larger than the raw data.

Another effect is that you are bundling several pieces of data together into larger chunks. Sometimes this is a positive effect, sometimes negative. Requesting fewer resources is positive, but only if the resources have the same caching status. If you for example bundle an image in an HTML page, the image can't be cached separately as it has to be fetched every time the HTML page is fetched.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

In the past, web browsers had heavy limits on the number of concurrent connections they could send to the server. This meant an image heavy website would need to queue up requests and wait for the ones before to finish. Base64 provided a way of working around that by using an already open HTTP connection to deliver images embedded directly into the HTML or CSS. This effectively removed the need for an extra roundtrip the browser would need for each of the files.

Fast forward to todays technology and you're looking at download size increase, CPU overhead, and hurting your SEO and User Experience.
The issues are actually not only limited to performance. By using Base64 encoded images on your website, you might also be hurting both your SEO and user experience.

We're making good progress and we were finally able to get the maps to work and add our own custom designed pins to it. It was quite a learning experience.
