## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using the Mapbox API technology and scrum principles for team management. We have also utilized paired programming quite a bit. 

2. What went well so far?

How well our team is able to communicate and how well we work together.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I would take more breaks. We have difficulty stopping to take a break and it causes us to get overwhelmed and burnt out sometimes.
