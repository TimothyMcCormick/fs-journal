# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Our overall capstone project. We feel like we put a lot into it and made a really cool app that people might actually want to use.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

We basically had 3 weeks to work on this project and still didn't get it to the point we wanted to. 

- What are you struggling with?

Thinking through complex javascript functions.

- What would you count as a victory?

Deployed our app and we are pretty proud of what we came up with!
