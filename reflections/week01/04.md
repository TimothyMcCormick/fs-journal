## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wireframes keep the webpage concept user-focused. They can help define website features by giving you the ability to visualize how it all works together. They are also cheap and easy to make.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity - basic design structure.. easy to draw out with pen and paper as a simple layout.

Mid-fidelity - more accurate representation but without colors or images as to avoid unnecessary distractions.. usually created using a digital wireframing tool.

High-fidelity - most detailed wireframing. Can include images and written content and the ability to explore menu systems or interactive maps.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Absolutely. They give you the ability to get a basic to advanced layout built beforehand so you have a roadmap to follow. You can get important user, client and stakeholder approval before getting into the nitty gritty website building process.
