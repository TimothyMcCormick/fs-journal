## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Using box-shadow rather than a full on border. When I'm viewing someones webpage, borders tend to turn me off to it while a page built with more subtle outlining gives it a cleaner look.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Bootstrap. Dribbble color search.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Visitors won't get as frustrated with your webpage if it has a nice design and UI. It can make the site more appealing and tell viewers it was designed by a professional.
