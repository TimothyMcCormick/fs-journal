## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A pseudo-class is when you assign a special action to an element. For example, hovering over a button and a clicking hand appears or when you set the color of an element to change when you mouse over it.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is used in css to measure relevance of css selectors. It can save you time in debugging and give you the ability to order your styling by importance.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

CSS specificity is built in for a reason to be used to help you with your styling. Using !important overrides that styling and can make it difficult in the long run to apply a particular style you want. Continuing to use it multiple times just adds to the confusion and chaos so it's better to just not use it.
