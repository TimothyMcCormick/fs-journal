# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Even though at around tuesday-wednesday I was overwhelmed almost to the point of not thinking I would be able to do this, I was still able to figure it out and power through. I'm doing things I didn't think possible in only a weeks worth of time learning.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

Getting a webpage to lay out the way you want is a lot harder than I thought!

- What are you struggling with?

My biggest struggle is understanding d-flex. With my Friday Checkpoint I have some centered text in a column over a background image and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get the text more up and to the left instead of centered. But I will keep messing with it!

- What would you count as a victory?

Making it through the first week and being able to meet all of the checkpoint requirements... I think. We'll see when it's graded...
