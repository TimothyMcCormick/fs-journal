## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants.

You can use enums when you want to create a class of unchangeable/read-only variables.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

By changing its type.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

No I have not but here is an example of how you could use one:

enum Day {
    Sunday,
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday
};
