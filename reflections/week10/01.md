## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Type:

-A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.

Reference Type:

-Unlike value types, a reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

Pointer Type:

-Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object. Also, boxing and unboxing do not support pointers. However, you can convert between different pointer types and between pointer types and integral types.

-A pointer cannot point to a reference or to a struct that contains references, because an object reference can be garbage collected even if a pointer is pointing to it. The garbage collector does not keep track of whether an object is being pointed to by any pointer types.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong and ushort. Biggest difference I notice is there are a lot more than in JavaScript.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Value types are stored on stack memory. Whereas reference types are stored on heap memory. Value type get freed on its own from stack when they go out of scope. Whereas reference type need garbage collector to free memory.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Did rock paper scissors console game in c#. It is a bit clunky and I feel like I could do some refactoring which I probably will go back and do. It does what it's supposed to do though, so I'll take that as a win.
