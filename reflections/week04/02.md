> **ðŸ“– [JavaScript Promises](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/02-Promises)**

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails
Resolved: Completed Promise
Rejected: Failed Promise

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

By using chaining. You can chain multiple callbacks to give your code a cleaner look and still achieving the same outcome.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The then() method is called after the Promise is resolved. Then we can decide what to do with the resolved Promise.

The catch() method is used after the then() method

If the promise gets rejected, it will jump to the catch() method and this time we will see a different message on the console.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Asynchronous code is not as scary as it sounds. Building out the MVC structure is basically the same but the async coding allows you to stop your code from continuing to run when you need to wait for the network to return a result. Using axios really helps to make this easier as well.
