# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Working with the MVC Pattern is getting easier.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I'm terrible at figuring out javascript functions and I constantly fight with html layout.

- What are you struggling with?

As mentioned already, javascript functions. Also, figuring out the correct paths when accessing information on the API takes me awhile.

- What would you count as a victory?

Getting more comfortable with html, css and imports and exports using the mvc pattern.
