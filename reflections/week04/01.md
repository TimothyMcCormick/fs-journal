> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

When you start to see a pyramid shape and all the '})'s at the end of your code to the point where it's almost unreadable. This is caused when you try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous is a way to tell your function not to run this right away but wait until a something else is done first. Callbacks are used in async code to tell it to return "example" when it's finished. Like with downloading a photo, return when it's done downloading.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Donâ€™t nest functions. Give them names and place them at the top level of your program
Use function hoisting to your advantage to move functions â€˜below the foldâ€™
Handle every single error in every one of your callbacks. Use a linter like standard to help you with this.
Create reusable functions and place them in a module to reduce the cognitive load required to understand your code. Splitting your code into small pieces like this also helps you handle errors, write tests, forces you to create a stable and documented public API for your code, and helps with refactoring.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Asynchronous code sounds a lot scary than it actually is. Building out the MVC structure is basically the same, you just wrap it with async functions(if needed) Using axios really helps to make things easier as well. Also, its pretty cool to reach out to other databases using api.
