## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

2. What does Stateless mean?

The REST API is stateless meaning that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes the HTTP request, it will contain all the necessary information to make the server understand the requests sent from the client.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

http(s)://{Domain name indicating REST API(:Port number)}/{API version}/{path for identifying a resource}

URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
Use HTTP methods (HTTP/1.1) to operate on these resources:
Use HTTP response status codes to represent the outcome of operations on resources.

First assignment where I used a get method to put an image on my page. I was able to use a bit of what I learned here to do my checkpoint assignment. Also, learned its difficult for me to work with others but I feel like I'm getting better at it.
