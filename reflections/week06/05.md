# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I was able to practice more with what we learned than I have in previous weeks.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

Vue makes building a web app much faster.

- What are you struggling with?

Routes and logic in general. Couldn't figure out for the life of me how to make a like/unlike function.

- What would you count as a victory?

I was able to meet 12 out of 16 requirements on my checkpoint. This one was extremely hard for me. I'm hoping to get some pointers on monday to hopefully get a second chance to meet the rest.
