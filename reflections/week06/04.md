## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

A nested route is a route link placed inside a parent route using the "router-link" tag. Allowing you to make connections between parent and child components.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

Say you have a travel page with different destinations and when you go to a destination you have multiple things you can do at each destination. You can create a nested route linking things to do at each destination as children routes of the parent destination route.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes you can. If you need to pass information from the parent route to the child route. This is useful when you have more data of a particular type (users, pictures, etc.) that you are wishing to display on your site/app.
