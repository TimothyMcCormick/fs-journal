## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

Component based architecture is the ability to split up your code into different components for readability and organization sake giving us cleaner code. For example, in todays lecture we created boss monster and had separate component files for the boss and heros. You can think of a component as a small feature that makes up a piece of the user interface.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

Helps you to write cleaner code and keep it more organized. Also, components contain structure, helper methods, and routing features all within a single class. Which means that developers donâ€™t have to spend much time trying to find which functions pertain to which parts of an applicationâ€™s UI. Components are also reusable so if you had different chat windows or something along those lines they could resemble one another, but still work independently.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Importing and exporting can become a bit more complicated when using separate components. Also, since its main purpose is to encapsulate responsibilities within one space. When using many components, there is the possibility that readability might actually become degraded

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Took me awhile to actually get the project loaded and working due to debugging error after error so I didn't make it all the way through. I found that using vue makes it a lot faster to build out applications. Super cool. I'm hoping to pick up the syntax and importing and exporting quickly.
