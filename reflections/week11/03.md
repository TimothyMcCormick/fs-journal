## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution. For example, to dump the database content. It is a type of attack that can give a competitor complete control over your web application database by inserting willful SQL code into a database query.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

I couldn't find anything in the reading referring to this but I did find this on google: SQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind) and Out-of-band SQLi. 

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

To Detect:

- A web application firewall (WAF) can detect and block basic SQL injection attacks

- Intrusion detection systems (IDS), both network- and host-based, can be tuned to detect SQL injection attacks. Network-based IDSes can monitor all connections to your database server, and flag suspicious activity. A host-based IDS can monitor web server logs and alert when something strange happens.

Prevention:

- Validating user inputs is a frequent initial step in mitigating SQL injection attacks. To begin, determine the most important SQL statements and create a whitelist for all legal SQL statements, excluding unvalidated statements from the query. Input validation or request redesign are terms used to describe this procedure.

- Utilize the principle of least privilege(link is external) when provisioning accounts used to connect to the SQL database.  For example, if a web site only needs to retrieve web content from a database using SELECT statements, do not give the web site's database connection credentials other privileges such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE privileges.

Had some more practice on inheritance and interfaces and I feel like I'm understanding the 2 concepts and differences more.
