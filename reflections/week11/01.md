## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance gives you the ability to describe a relationship between two classes. One of the classes is called a derived class, and the other is a base class. The derived class is an extension of the base class and it inherits everything the base class has.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Not all members of a class are inherited. For example, constructors are not inheritable in C#.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

While all other members of a base class are inherited by derived classes, whether they are visible or not depends on their accessibility. A member's accessibility affects its visibility. For example:

- Private members are visible only in derived classes that are nested in their base class. Otherwise, they are not visible in derived classes.

- Protected members are visible only in derived classes.

- Internal members are visible only in derived classes that are located in the same assembly as the base class. They are not visible in derived classes located in a different assembly from the base class.

- Public members are visible in derived classes and are part of the derived class' public interface. Public inherited members can be called just as if they are defined in the derived class.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Worked with interfaces. I can see how having that basic structure defined out for you can help with your servers architecture. I end up changing everything that was pre-filled out in the repo since the naming wasn't the way I wanted it to be.
