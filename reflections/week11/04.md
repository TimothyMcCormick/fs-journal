## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I loved the course. Very challenging at times but beneficial. I feel like I've grown in more ways than in just my Software Development abilities. I'm realizing the value of teamwork and of networking and I'm understanding myself more and more everyday. My concerns as of right now would probably be not passing the final and not being able to find a job out of the course due to people in the job market having more experience than me and me having trouble really marketing myself. As far as time management goes, I'm going to continue doing what I have been doing all throughout the course, utilizing pomodoro clock and asking for help when I need it. When the course is over I plan on continuing to code everyday and making applying for jobs my full time job. What I've enjoyed most about the course so far is how helpful and awesome all the instructors and TA's have been, I can tell you guys truly do want us to succeed, all the awesome friendships I've made with my classmates and finally how much personal growth I've gone through during this time. I'm truly amazed with this course and grateful for the opportunity to be able to do it.
