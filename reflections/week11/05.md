# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

Feel like I'm understanding C# pretty well.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

I created an elevator pitch! I hate talking about myself...

- What are you struggling with?

Many to many relationships of course

- What would you count as a victory?

Almost done with the server side on my final and only 2 weeks left of the course!
