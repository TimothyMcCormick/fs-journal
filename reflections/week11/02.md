## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is used to define the primary id for that model whereas a foreign key defines an id on the model that is coming from another model. For example on the table below, doctorId is a foreign key that references the id from the doctors table on column id.

2. What is an `Alias`?

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

      SELECT
        d.*,
        dp.id AS DoctorsPatientsId
      FROM doctorsPatients dp
      JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId
      WHERE dp.patientId = @id

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I feel like I'm understanding the many to many relationships more. Definitely need more practice with it though.
