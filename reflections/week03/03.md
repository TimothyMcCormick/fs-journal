## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Get and Set. We use get to get the value of a key and set to set a new key

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

Add a second parameter to access the property value.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

It becomes like a bouncer in a club. The user has to go through the proxy when accessing data (the VIP room). Therefore keeping the data more private and less likely to be changed.
