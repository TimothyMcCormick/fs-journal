The observer patterns gives you a way to update parts of a page in response to certain events.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The Subscribe Method, Unsubscribe Method and Broadcast Method.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
