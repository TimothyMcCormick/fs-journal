## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is used for hiding information. It is based on the concept that object properties should not be exposed publicly to the outside world. Using Encapsulation prevents access to the variables by adding public entities inside an object, which the callers can use to achieve specific results.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

By using the underscore prefix you leak implementation details and expand attack surface for hackers. Also, if you use the underscore convention, you rely on the user to know what it means and to understand that you donâ€™t intend for them to use it.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

By using closures and private fields. Also by using a privileged method, which is a method that has access to the private data inside he containing functionâ€™s scope. Privileged functions and methods have reference-based access to the containing functionâ€™s variables even after the containing function has returned.
