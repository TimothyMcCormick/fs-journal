# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I started out thinking there was no way I was going to be able to figure out the MVC pattern but as I practiced more with it I felt more and more comfortable.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

I got an extra day to work on my assignment! Probably wouldn't have been able to finish it if I didn't.

- What are you struggling with?

Functions. It takes me forever to figure out how to get the function to work how I want and I'm having trouble understanding the logic side of it

- What would you count as a victory?

I made it through another week!
