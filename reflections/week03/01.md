## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

It is a maintainable approach that allows us to keep things separated, and only available when we need it. The export keyword is used when we want to make something available somewhere, and the import is used to access what export has made available.

2. How does export differ from export default?

Named exports are useful to export several values. During the import, one will be able to use the same name to refer to the corresponding value.

With the default export, there is only a single default export per module. A default export can be a function, a class, an object or anything else. This value is to be considered as the ‚Äúmain‚Äù exported value since it will be the simplest to import.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

To help keep your code organized and scalable. Modules allow you to, split your code it into multiple, role-specific files (which makes maintenance easier when compared with managing all of your code in one file), reuse code for multiple applications without having to copy that code from application to application, and  automatically load the code you need based on what the code itself requires rather than manually specifying each file to load.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Using this method is difficult to learn but I'm beginning to pick it up better. I can see how this level of code organization will help me a ton in the future and I'm excited to figure it out (and continue to learn it over time) so that I can keep my files more maintainable and organized.
