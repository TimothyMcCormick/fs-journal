## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is a way to document your code so that you or other colleagues can remember/know how specific functions work or how they might need to be set up. Here's is some ways you could document your code:

-howtos/guides for using your code
-a README for the repo
-code documentation in the source

Example of code documentation:

/**

  Generates a table head

  @param {HTMLTableElement} table - The target HTML table

  @param {Array} data - The array of cell header names

 */

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Adding JSDoc documentation has a side effect. Auto completion will improve in your IDE and youâ€™ll get real-time hints.

Moreover, the editor will scream if you try to pass the wrong kind of parameters.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Writing documentation for your code can help your future self and your colleagues.

 Also, it's not that hard to add documentation after finishing a method or class. Thatâ€™s where tools like JSDoc can come in handy.
