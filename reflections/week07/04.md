# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Took breaks every 50 minutes. Switched driver and navigator roles every few minutes. My partner and I made sure we were programming out loud. Took into account how a user would feel about their experience with the Tower application I built.

2. What went well this week?

I feel like I learned a ton with vue and backend server work this week. This will help a lot in the coming weeks.

3. What would you do differently?

Not be afraid to ask more questions. I get trapped in my head thinking I should be able to figure it out on my own. Typically because I start comparing myself to others.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Finished up the backend and began the front end today. It was really cool working with the server tests. It was kind of like a road map to follow and will help me a lot in the future when building out servers.
