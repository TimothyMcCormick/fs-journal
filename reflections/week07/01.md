## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two programmers share a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse). 
The roles are: The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the ‚Äúnavigator‚Äù. You switch roles every few minutes.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

-Increased code quality: ‚Äúprogramming out loud‚Äù leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going   down blind alleys.

-Better diffusion of knowledge among the team, in particular when a developer unfamiliar with a component is pairing with one who knows it much better.

-better transfer of skills, as junior developers pick up micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

-At least the driver, and possibly both programmers, are expected to keep up a running commentary; pair programming is also ‚Äúprogramming out loud‚Äù ‚Äì if the driver is silent, the navigator should intervene.

-Both programmers must be actively engaging with the task throughout a paired session, otherwise no benefit can be expected.

-Pair programming cannot be fruitfully forced upon people, especially if relationship issues, including the most mundane (such as personal hygiene), are getting in the way.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Figured out a good system for working with my partner. I feel like if we stick with this and keep up the communication it will really help with partner projects down the road. One thing I'd probably change is switching who is driving and who is navigating more often. We didn't do that as much as we should have.
