## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

You can use it to read printed messages or errors, allowing you to debug your code more easily. You can also use it to test your functions to make sure they are working as intended.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

In the elements tab. It can be useful in debugging html because it shows you the line in which your error lies so you can you back to your code and know exactly where it is that you need to fix.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

The best way to debug your code is to use breakpoints. After setting a breakpoint you can use tools to step into, step out of or play through your breakpoints. This allows you to go step by step through your code in real time to determine where the break down of communication is occuring.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This project is the first one that I used a dictionary on and learned how to navigate through the different keys and arrays. I also learned how to create a template out of my html code and plug it into javascript. This can be very useful when you have repeating elements on a page.
