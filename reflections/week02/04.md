## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan before you start writing your code is vital. It's like creating a blueprint before you build a house. It helps you decide where to start and helps you figure out the main steps between the start and the finish. Just like on my friday challenge. I had no idea where to even start but the guide steps that were carefully planned for us really helped get me going and progressing to the state that it is now.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I find answers by asking someone for help who knows more than I do, researching through Google and taking breaks so my mind can have time away from the computer to think the problem through. A lot of times I'm able to figure out how to solve a problem in my head before actually sitting down to write the code.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Make a plan before writing my code, think about the best solution to your problem, don't give up, Google if needed, have a good attitude towards code reviewers, thinking of the reviews as opportunities for improvement, learn to love errors and take lots of breaks.
