## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Function Declaration - use the function keyword followed by the name of the function. When using this method, the function definition is hoisted, allowing the function to be used before it is defined. Example:

function name(parameters){

}

Function Expressions - defines a named or anonymous function. Function Expressions are not hoisted, so they cannot be used before they are defined. Example:

let name = function(parameters){

}

Arrow Function Expression- An easier method of writing function expressions.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when defining a function and arguments are the actual values the function receives when the function is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

When a function accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function back to you. Examples:

Array.filter()
setTimeout()

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Functions are objects and are essentially the building blocks of a program. A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. You can call on them many times, saving you a lot of time when you need to perform a similar action in many different places of the script.
