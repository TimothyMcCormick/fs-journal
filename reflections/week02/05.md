# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Learning how to use conditionals and writing functions. 

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

I can build a functioning game with javascript. When I started it, I honestly didn't think I was going to be able to figure it out.

- What are you struggling with?

Figuring out when (with what functions) you would want to write a for loop in.

- What would you count as a victory?

Man, I don't even know where to start. Every time I was able to get a function working in my friday checkpoint, I celebrated. My wife was super impressed(definitely not annoyed ðŸ™„)
