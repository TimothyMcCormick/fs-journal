## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is referring to where your variables are available for use. If you create a variable outside of a block it is globally available. In other words, anywhere in the window. If your variable is declared inside a block, it's only available inside that block.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is when you declare a variable at the top of your scope before your code execution. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

You would use var if you want to declare the variable globally or within a function. Var can be updated or re-declared. Let is block scoped and can be updated but not re-declared. If you don't want to worry about if you've used a variable before, let would be the better choice. Const can't be updated or re-declared so if you are creating an array, const would be the preferred variable to use.
