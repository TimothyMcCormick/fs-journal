## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

You can reduce the amount of meetings needed that negatively impact the time the development team needs to complete their work if you just communicate more often.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Dial in your communications. Figure out when are you communicating, who is involved and what is being communicated. If you can communicate effectively, as mentioned above, there will be less meetings needed.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle is: "Good-Fast-Cheap". The tradeoffs for each are:

-Good service Cheap wonâ€™t be Fast.

-Good service Fast wonâ€™t be Cheap.

-Fast service Cheap wonâ€™t be Good.
