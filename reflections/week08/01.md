## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

A portfolio should be a showcase of some of your work â€“ it shows your unique brand, what you stand for, what you like, dislike and what youâ€™re good at.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Helps you stand out from the crowd. Shows you have the skills needed for the job. It can increase your brand and show your expertise on a subject.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would include theNetwork, Inspire, my groups capstone, onTracker (when its done) and my final. I would improve on them in design and clean up some code. I would include these projects because I feel like they really show off my skills and could be impressive when trying to land a new job.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

My capstone group and I did our initial planning on our project and were able to get most of our data and design figured out. It's always difficult working together as a team initially but as we got to know each other and got ideas and some planning out, I think we're going to be able to come up with a pretty cool application together.
