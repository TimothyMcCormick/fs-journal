## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

  Unit Testing:

  -First-class error reporting

  -Active community and team

  Component Testing:

  -Optimal compatibility with the Vue ecosystem

  -First-class error reporting

  End-to-End (E2E) Testing:

  -Cross-browser testing

  -Faster feedback loops

  -First class debugging experience

  -Visibility in headless mode


2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

End to end testing because it provides coverage on what happens when users actually use your applications and validates all the layers of your application

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

In my opinion unit testing is least important because it only tests small bits of code for functionality rather than seeing the overall functionality that comes from component or end to end testing.
