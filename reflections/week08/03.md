## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Writing a little bit of code and testing it in small portions to make sure it works properly as opposed to writing a lot of code and trying to launch your program and finding out nothing is working, leaving you to backtrace through everything you wrote to figure out where all the problems are. If you only wrote a little bit of code then you should know exactly where the issue lies when your test doesn't work.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

-It helps to eliminate worry, giving you peace of mind.

-When you unit test, it gives you confidence knowing that everything is working properly before you send it off to the QA team.

-It's more efficient, QA testing takes days to weeks when a unit test only takes a few minutes.

-When writing a unit test it gives the code documentation.

-It gives you better design.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

-Takes more time.

-Unit tests may test edge cases that are never or extremely seldom seen in practice.

-Individual pieces may function properly, but the overall may not.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Finished up the backend today and moved on to the front end. It was really cool seeing the scrum practices in action, It helped a ton talking about what we were going to do that day and communicating throughout the day. We even were able to do more than what we originally planned on getting finished.
