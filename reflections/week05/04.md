## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

Virtuals are additional fields for a given model. Their values can be set manually or automatically with defined functionality. A common virtual property is the full name of a person, composed of userâ€™s first and last name.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

When you need additional information for a certain model like a name or something to help identify the model.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

You can't search by virtual property value. Virtuals are NOT available for document queries or field selection. Only non-virtual properties work for queries and field selections.
