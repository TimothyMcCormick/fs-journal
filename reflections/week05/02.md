## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

-One-To-One (1:1) 
-One-To-Many (1:N)
-Many-To-Many (N:M)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

With a 1:N relationship the advantage linking has is that additional comments will not grow the original Blog Post document, making it less likely that the applications will run in the maximum document size of 16 MB. Itâ€™s also much easier to return paginated comments as the application can slice and dice the comments more easily. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

It's difficult to see how everything will be related in a many-to-many relationship so you have to figure that out ahead of time and really think it all through. I would use LucidChart to map it all out first so I know exactly how to create it when it comes time to write the code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This was a little easier for me than front end work. I like the ability to use Postman to test your servers functionality and being able to create folders for organizing and testing your crud methods.
