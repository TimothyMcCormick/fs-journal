## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a time management technique that involves assigning fixed units of time to an activity or task in advance and then completing that activity or task during the designated time frame.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Practice and adapt:

I'm terrible at making the best use of my time so I'm going to practice and adapt by beginning to timebox and think about the time it takes to complete the task and inch by inch I will get better. 

Prioritizing:

I tend to just start on a task thats on my list without considering the priority of it. I'm going to implement this strategy by putting my task in order of highest priority to lowest priority.

‚ÄúSwallowing the frog‚Äù:

A lot of the time I will do the easy stuff first and put off the hard stuff but I'm going to switch that around and start with the hard stuff. I will feel like I can accomplish anything if I can get the hardest task done right of the gate.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

During a checkpoint 2 weeks ago. I didn't plan ahead and set specific time blocks for each task I needed to work on and I felt extremely overwhelmed just thinking about everything that needed to be done. If I would've planned and set aside chunks of time for each task then I would've been more productive in the long run.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This one was tough for me. I spent so much time building out the application data that I never even got to building the relationships. I feel like mapping out relationships is going to be one of the tougher challenges I'll be facing during this course. I hope to get more practice with it in the days to come. I did however get the chance to map it out with LucidChart and that was very helpful.
